1. Commenting Guidelines
------------------------
- Include comments to provide explanations, clarify intent, and document non-obvious code behavior.
- Use descriptive variable, function, and class names to minimize the need for comments.
- Use a consistent commenting style, such as single-line comments or block comments, throughout the codebase.
- Comment public APIs, specifying input parameters, return values, and expected behavior.

2. Naming Conventions
---------------------
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other code elements.
- Follow a consistent naming convention, such as camelCase or snake_case.
- Avoid ambiguous or overly abbreviated names; prioritize readability and clarity.

3. Documentation Blocks
-----------------------
- Use documentation blocks (e.g., JSDoc) to generate formal documentation for APIs or code references.
- Document function signatures, input parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- Include examples and usage guidelines in documentation blocks to aid developers using the code.

4. Code Organization and Structure
---------------------------------
- Organize code files into logical modules and directories based on their functionality.
- Follow a consistent file and folder naming convention.
- Separate concerns and keep files, functions, and classes focused on specific tasks.
- Clearly indicate dependencies and imports at the beginning of files.

5. Code Formatting
------------------
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces) for code blocks and maintain a readable and consistent code layout.
- Place spaces around operators and between function arguments for clarity.
- Break long lines of code into multiple lines to improve readability.
- Follow language-specific formatting conventions and idiomatic patterns.
- Add authorships, timestamps and details of the implemented/updated codes in every functionalities.
    use this as example:
        <!-- Author: John Doe -->
        <!-- Added on: 2023-06-30 -->
        <!-- Description: This section displays user information -->

6. Version Control and Change Log
---------------------------------
- Utilize version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking code changes and collaboration.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages that summarize the changes made.
- Include authorship information and timestamps through the version control system.
- Maintain a change log to document major changes, new features, and bug fixes.
    - Include author name, timestamp, and a brief description for each entry in the change log.

7. Documentation Tools and Platforms
------------------------------------
- Specify the preferred documentation tools or platforms for generating and maintaining project documentation.
- Provide guidelines on how to generate and update documentation using the specified tools.
- Include any specific rules or requirements for documenting code architecture, API endpoints, or other project-specific documentation needs.
